# CS-300 Portfolio Reflection

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The goal was to build a program that could efficiently read course information from a file, organize it using different data structures, and allow users to quickly look up courses and their prerequisites. The challenge involved deciding which data structure -vector, hash table, or binary search tree -would offer the best performance and usability for academic advisors managing course plans.

### How did you approach the problem?
I approached the problem by first working with the three data structures: vector, hash table, and binary search tree we had as options in milestone assignments leading up to the final project. I focused on how efficiently each structure could read, store, and retrieve course data, and decided to work with hash tables.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
One challenge was ensuring the data parsed correctly and prerequisites were accurately matched. I used print statements and step-by-step debugging to confirm each course was being created and stored correctly.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project helped me focus more on runtime analysis and planning before coding. I realized that choosing the right data structure from the beginning can save time and avoid complications later. It also reinforced how important it is to think about future scalability and maintainability.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I now try to write code that is modular and easier to debug. By separating the code into methods for reading files, inserting data, and searching, the program became easier to update and scale up. Adding comments and keeping naming consistent also helped with readability and made it easier to keep track my work.
